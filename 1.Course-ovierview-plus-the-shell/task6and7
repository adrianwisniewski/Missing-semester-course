You must understand that Linux doesn't really look at the file extension in order to determine what the file (or program) is. So as long as the content of that file is written in a way that the sh interpreter understands, it will work. But just for the sake of readability, such files are normally given an .sh extension and I have no idea what the developer was thinking when he gave that file a .txt extension

so with program "sh" telling bash linux to exucute file
